# [.NET Core Web API Starter](https://github.com/dalbitresb12/netcore-webapi-starter)

This [template](https://github.com/dalbitresb12/netcore-webapi-starter) should help get you started developing a Web API using .NET Core 6. It includes opinionated configurations for JetBrains Rider, Visual Studio, [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) with commit hooks (powered by [Husky.Net](https://alirezanet.github.io/Husky.Net/)).

This project was generated using Rider's .NET Core Web API template using version 2022.1.1.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[JetBrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) or [Microsoft Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

## Project Setup

You should also have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.com/) installed for commitlint to work (any supported LTS version should be fine).

If you don't have Node.js installed, it is highly encouraged that you install it using a version manager:

- Linux/MacOS: use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- Windows: use [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

After that, just open the project on your preferred IDE from the [list above](#recommended-ide-setup).

## Development server

Start a development server by running the ISS Express configuration from your IDE. Don't forget to trust the generated SSL certificate.

## Build

Run `dotnet build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `bin/` directory.
